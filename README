Small app to visualize all pull requests for your configured projects, depending on your company.

copy your config-file to the "conf" folder. the name of this configfile represents also your url

your config-file must contain the following entries:
1. organization
2. secret
3. projects

example:
myConfigFile.conf
-------------------------
organization = "myOrga"
secret = "my secret key"
projects = [
  "project1",
  "project2"
]
----------------------------

now you could see all your PRs at /pullrequests/myConfigFile

start your app with ./run --> it will run on :9000

you could add the parameter "offline" to to run against a sample client. No internet connection needed -> using a sample

--> ./run offline
